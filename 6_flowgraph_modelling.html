    <h1>Computer modelling</h1>
    <p><b><font size="+1"><font color="#ff0000">Note: Regrettably, the
            Java applet on this page has not been updated to current
            standard implementations of Java. <br>
            The applet can only run by removing the standard high security
            settings.</font></font></b><br>
    </p>
    <p> While formulating, manipulating and solving small flowgraphs on
      paper is straightforward and insightful, it's very helpful to have
      a patient and capable machine assistant to remove the drudgery,
      avoid mistakes and save on paper. </p>
    <p>Click on the link below for a computer application which enables
      flowgraph modelling from a web browser. <br>
      The Java applet may take a few moments to load. Once the blank
      worksheet has appeared with its grey toolbar you can start by
      double-clicking in the blank area to create the first node.
      Doubleclick elsewhere to create a second node and connect them by
      cntrl-click-drag (Mac) or rightclick-drag (PC). </p>
    <p>The Appendix of the book <i>Macroeconomic Models in a Causal
        Framework</i> provides a brief description of how to use this
      tool, and this can be downloaded as a pdf file: <a
        href="6_files/Appendix.pdf">download Appendix</a> (88Kb). </p>
    <p><a href="6_files/modeller.htm"><img src="6_files/ISLM.gif"
          alt="IS-LM diagraph" align="right"></a> Note that the graphs
      you create cannot be saved or copied as manipulatable objects,
      though you can save them, frozen, as picture files with a screen-
      or window-capture utility - <i>i.e.</i> in Windows use the
      PrintScreen or Cntrl-PrintScreen command from the keyboard, or in
      Mac OSX use the "Grab" application. The picture can then be pasted
      into another application like a paint program or a word processor.
      To print out, again use a screen- or window-capture utility. </p>

    <p>To avoid losing your work it's best to open it in a new window of
      your browser. </p>
