    <h1>Dynamics in Causal Graphs</h1>
    <p> Macroeconomic models which deal with the accumulation of flows
      into stocks or with expectations about the future are inherently
      dynamic: they involve differential or difference equations. They
      are incorporated into a causal graph via an operator: the Laplace
      operator for continuous time or the lag operator for discrete
      time. Economic models are usually expressed in discrete time. Then
      the lag operator L is treated as an algebraic parameter and enters
      into the transmittances. </p>
    <p> Consider a Phillips curve model as set out in these equations:</p>
    <p> <img src="Phillips.gif" alt="graph of Phillips curve
        model" align="right"> <i>&#960; = &#960;<sup>e</sup> + e(y <tt>-</tt>
        y*) </i></p>
    <p><i> y = a<sub>0</sub> <tt>-</tt> a(i <tt>-</tt> &#960;<sup>e</sup> )
      </i></p>
    <p><i> &#960;<sup>e</sup> = </i>L<i>&#960; </i></p>
    <p><i> i = b<sub>1</sub>y <tt>-</tt> b<sub>2 </sub> </i>L<i>(m <tt>-</tt>
        p) </i></p>
    <p><i> m = </i>L<i>m + &#956;</i> </p>
    <p> where <i>p</i> is the price level, &#960;<sup>e</sup> is the
      expected rate of inflation, <i>y</i> is output, <i>y*</i> is the
      natural level of output, <i>i</i> is the nominal interest rate, <i>m</i>
      is the stock of money and &#956; is its rate of growth. Variables <i>p,
        y, y*</i> and <i>m</i> are measured in logarithms. Both <i>m</i>
      and <i>p</i> are measured at the end of the period. The lag
      operator L simply lags the variable it is attached to, so L<i>m</i>
      is <i>m</i><sub>t-1</sub>; where it appears in the form (1-L)<sup>-1</sup>
      it implies accumulation or time integration. </p>
    <p> This simple model assumes that expected inflation is equal to
      the actual inflation rate in the previous period. It assumes &#956; and
      <i>y*</i> to be exogenous and we can ask <i>e.g.</i> how a (unit
      step) increase in &#956; or <i>y*</i> would affect any of the other,
      endogenous, variables. </p>
    <p> Although there is sufficient information in this model to work
      out the full time path of effects, in fact the main ones of
      interest are "impact" or short-run effects and long-run effects.
      When we have the required transmittance as a function of L then
      the former are given by setting L = 0 and the latter by setting L
      = 1. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> The flowgraph has four loops and one pair of non-touching loops,
      so the system determinant is:<br>
      &#8710; = (1 - L)(1 + <i>ab</i><sub>1</sub>) - <i>ae</i>L(1 - <i>b</i><sub>2</sub>/(1

      - L)) <br>
      and to illustrate the application of Mason's rule to find short-
      and long-run transmittances we consider two examples, namely the
      transmittance from a step increase in natural output <i>y*</i> to
      actual output <i>y</i>, and from a step increase in the growth
      rate of the money stock &#956; to the level of real balances <i>m-p</i>.
      Mason's rule gives a general formula which involves the lag
      operator L, and this is the "transfer function" (indicated by the
      angle brackets below). From this we find the the short-run effects
      by setting L = 0 and the long-run effects by setting L = 1: <br>
      <img src="equations.gif" alt="transmittances from y* and
        mu to y and m-p" align="left"> </p>
    <p> An increase in the natural level of output <i>y*</i> impinges
      on the other variables in this model via a reduced rate of
      inflation. This in turn has two offsetting effects: (i) expected
      inflation falls, which increases the real interest rate and
      thereby reduces output; and (ii) real balances rise as inflation
      is now less than the growth of the money stock, and this reduces
      the real interest rate, thereby stimulating output. Output is only
      affected from either route with a one-period delay, so there is no
      impact effect on <i>y</i>. Thereafter both of the offsetting
      effects come into play, but the second effect dominates in the
      long run because it is a dynamic process which only comes to an
      end when output has increased to the new natural level and there
      is no further supply side attenuation of inflation. All this can
      be seen in the flowgraph, and it is confirmed in the algebra. </p>
    <p> An increase in the money growth rate <em>initially increases</em>
      real balances as might be expected, but eventually, after the
      inflationary process thus engendered has come to a new equilibrium
      with inflation proceeding at the same rate as money growth, the
      level of real balances will have <em>fallen</em>—by an amount
      equal to the interest semi-elasticity of the demand for money, 1/<i>b<sub>2</sub></i>.
    </p>
    <p> Despite this model's rudimentary assumption about expectations,
      it confirms the basic results of "expectations adjusted Phillips
      curve models". </p>
