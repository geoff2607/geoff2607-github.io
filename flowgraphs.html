Once the blank worksheet has appeared with its grey toolbar you can start by double-clicking in the blank area to create the first node. Doubleclick elsewhere to create a second node and connect them by cntrl-click-drag (Mac) or rightclick-drag (PC).<p>The Appendix of the book <i>Macroeconomic Models in a Causal Framework</i> provides a brief description of how to use this tool, and this can be downloaded as a pdf file: <A HREF="6_files/Appendix.pdf">download Appendix</A> (88Kb).<p><A HREF="6_files/index.html"><img src="6_files/ISLM.gif" alt="IS-LM diagraph" align="right"></A>Note that the graphs you create cannot be saved or copied as manipulatable objects, though you can save them, frozen, as picture files with a screen- or window-capture utility - <i>i.e.</i> in Windows use the  PrintScreen or Cntrl-PrintScreen command from the keyboard, or in Mac OSX use the "Grab" application.The picture can then be pasted into another application like a paint program or a word processor. To print out, again use a screen- or window-capture utility.<p><h3>Open <A HREF="6_files/index.html"> flowgraph modeller</A>.</h3><p>To avoid losing your work it's best to open it in a new window of your browser. <address> Acknowledgement: the Java applet was created by Thomas K.
